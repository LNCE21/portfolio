# **Personal Portfolio**
I have developed a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of my personal website so that I can start using it right away.


<<<<<<< HEAD
### **Installation**
You just need to run the code with live server, an extension for Visual Studio Code.


### **Layout**
I've decided to make a simple design so that i can showcase my other projects.
I've included media queries for responsiveness and a little bit of Javascript for the user experience when on mobile devices so the nav bar transforms to a Hamburger Menu.


### **Incoming new features:**
1. Contact form, to leave a message.
2. Fixed navigation bar, that way when the user begins to scroll, it will be easier for him to reach another section.
3. Improve the overall layout.
